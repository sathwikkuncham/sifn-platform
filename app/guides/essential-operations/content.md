# Essential Operations for Startups

Building a successful startup requires more than just a great idea and product. This guide covers the essential operational aspects of running a startup that founders often overlook but are critical for long-term success.

## Legal Foundation

### Business Structure

Choosing the right legal structure is a crucial early decision:

- **Sole Proprietorship**: Simple but offers no liability protection
- **LLC (Limited Liability Company)**: Flexible, tax-efficient, with liability protection
- **C-Corporation**: Standard for venture-backed startups, allows for multiple stock classes
- **S-Corporation**: Tax advantages for smaller startups with limitations on shareholders

### Founder Agreements

Establish clear agreements between founders:

- **Equity split**: Document ownership percentages
- **Vesting schedules**: Typically 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff
- **Roles and responsibilities**: Define who does what

- **Exit and departure scenarios**: What happens if someone leaves

### Intellectual Property Protection

Protect your innovations:

- **Trademarks**: For brand names, logos, and slogans
