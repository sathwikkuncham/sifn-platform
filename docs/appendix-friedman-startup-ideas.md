# Appendix: How to Get and Evaluate Startup Ideas

*Based on Jared Friedman, Y Combinator*

This guide synthesizes the advice provided by Jared Friedman, Group Partner at Y Combinator, on generating and evaluating startup ideas, drawing from analysis of successful YC companies, Paul Graham's insights, and experience with thousands of startups.

## Core Philosophy

- **Uncertainty**: Nobody knows for sure which startup ideas will work. Success depends heavily on execution.
- **Likelihood**: However, certain types of ideas are much more likely to succeed than others.
- **Goal**: Stack the deck in your favor by starting with a promising idea.

## Part 1: Four Common Mistakes Founders Make with Startup Ideas

Avoid these pitfalls when choosing or developing your idea:

### Mistake #1: Not Solving a Real Problem (Solution In Search of a Problem - SISP)

**Description**: Building something that doesn't solve a problem users genuinely care about, even if you can articulate a problem. Often starts with a cool technology (like AI) and then looks for an application.

**Antidote**: Fall in love with a problem, not a solution. Start with a high-quality, real problem that people actually experience and care about solving. Avoid overly abstract societal problems (like "global poverty") as direct startup ideas; focus on something more specific and tractable.

### Mistake #2: Getting Stuck on a "Tarpit Idea"

**Description**: Ideas that seem appealing and easily solvable on the surface but are actually structurally very difficult or impossible to execute successfully. These ideas are common, attract many founders, but rarely succeed.

**Cause**: Usually involves a widespread problem lots of potential founders encounter, which seems like it could be easily solved with a startup, but has a hidden structural reason why it's very hard (which is why it hasn't been solved despite many attempts).

**Example**: An app to make coordinating plans with friends more efficient (the "stereotypical college student idea").

**Advice**:
- Google it: See who has tried this before.
- Talk to past founders: If possible, learn why previous attempts failed. Understand the hard part that caused others to fail.

### Mistake #3: Not Evaluating an Idea

**Description**: Jumping into the first idea you have without stopping to consider if it actually makes a good business.

### Mistake #4: Waiting for the Perfect Idea

**Description**: The opposite extreme – sitting around indefinitely waiting for a flawless idea that may never come.

**Reality**: No startup idea is perfect initially. They morph over time.

**Goal**: Find the "happy place" between jumping in too quickly and waiting forever. Think of your initial idea as a good starting point.

## Part 2: How to Know if Your Idea is Good (10 Key Questions Framework)

Use these questions to evaluate the potential of your startup idea:

### 1. Do you have Founder/Market Fit? (Arguably the most important)

**Definition**: Are you and your team the right people to be working on this specific idea?

**Reframing**: Don't just search for a good idea in the abstract; search for a good idea for your team.

**Example (Good Fit)**: Plangrid – Founders included Tracy (construction industry expertise) and Ralph (strong developer). They were perfectly suited to build an iPad app for construction blueprints.

### 2. How big is the market?

**Requirement**: Needs to be a large market, typically meaning a path to a billion-dollar valuation for a VC-backed startup.

**Two Types of Good Markets**:
- Big now.
- Small now but rapidly growing.

**Example (Growing)**: Coinbase – When they started in 2012, the Bitcoin trading market was tiny, but it was obvious it could become huge if Bitcoin succeeded.

### 3. How acute is the problem?

**Importance**: This relates back to Mistake #1 (SISP). Users need to really care about the problem your idea solves.

**Test**: Is the problem a "hair on fire" problem for your users?

**Example (Acute Problem)**: Brex – Before Brex, startups literally could not get corporate credit cards. This was a significant, acute pain point. If the alternative is nothing, it's likely a good problem.

### 4. Do you have competition?

**Counterintuitive Insight**: Competition is generally a good sign, not a bad one. It validates that a market exists. Lack of competition often means no one wants the product.

**Good Scenarios**:
- There are existing competitors, but you've identified something they've missed.
- The existing competitors simply "suck."

**Example**: Dropbox – Launched when ~20 cloud file storage companies already existed. However, most people didn't use any of them because their UIs were bad (required manual uploads via website). Drew Houston's insight was OS integration for automatic syncing, a step-function improvement.

### 5. Do you want this?

- Do you personally want this product/service to exist?
- Do you know people personally who want this? (If not, worry that maybe nobody does).

### 6. Did this only recently become possible or necessary?

**Why it Matters**: Recent changes (new technology, regulations, societal shifts, new problems) often create the best opportunities for new startups.

**Example (Tech/Problem)**: Checkr – API for background checks. Enabled by the rise of the gig economy (Uber, DoorDash, Instacart) needing to run checks on huge numbers of workers efficiently. Existing background check companies weren't suited for this new API-driven use case.

**Example (Societal Shift)**: Gather Town – Created a fun virtual space for hanging out online; pivoted to this during the COVID-19 pandemic when behavior changed dramatically.

### 7. Are there good proxies for this business?

**Definition**: A proxy is a large, successful company doing something similar to your startup, but not a direct competitor (e.g., in a different geography or adjacent market).

**Value**: Proxies help validate the potential of your model or market.

**Example**: Rappi (food delivery in Latin America) – DoorDash (successful food delivery in the US) served as a great proxy, suggesting the model could work elsewhere.

### 8. Is this an idea you'd want to work on for years?

**Nuance**: While important, passion can grow over time, especially if the business starts working. Don't discard ideas only because they seem "boring" initially.

**Example**: Gusto (payroll software) – Likely not initially passionate about payroll, but it's a good business, and success builds passion.

**Reality Check**: The day-to-day grind of building a startup (coding, fixing bugs, talking to users) is largely the same regardless of how "fun" the initial idea sounded.

### 9. Is this a scalable business?

**Software**: Pure software typically scales infinitely well.

**Watch Out For**: Services businesses (agencies, dev shops) or anything requiring high-skilled human labor to serve each customer, as these are harder to scale like venture-backed startups need to.

### 10. Is this a good idea space?

**Definition (Dalton Caldwell)**: An idea space is a category or class of closely related startup ideas (e.g., software for hospitals, infrastructure monitoring tools, food delivery services). It's one level of abstraction up from a specific idea.

**Key Insight**: Different idea spaces have wildly different success rates (hit rates). Some are much more fertile than others.

**Examples (High Hit Rate historically)**: Fintech infrastructure, Vertical SaaS for enterprise.

**Examples (Lower Hit Rate historically)**: Consumer hardware, social networks, AdTech.

**Strategy**: It's worthwhile to consciously pick a good idea space to hunt for ideas within – one with a reasonable expected hit rate and good founder/market fit for your team.

**Example**: Fivetran – Started as a general data analysis tool (poor idea space), talked to customers, learned about problems, and eventually pivoted into data integration/pipelines within the fertile data analysis idea space.

## Part 3: How to Come Up With Startup Ideas (7 Recipes + Bonus)

While the best way is often to notice ideas organically, here are explicit methods:

### Organic Discovery (Preferred)

Most (~70%) of the top YC companies found their ideas organically, not by brainstorming. The problem with explicit brainstorming is it often leads to bad ideas (like tar pits).

### Setting Yourself Up for Organic Discovery (Long Game)

- Become an expert in something valuable.
- Work at a startup (to gain expertise).
- Build things you personally find interesting (sometimes they turn into startups, like Replit).

### Explicit Recipes for Generating Ideas Now

(Listed roughly in order of likelihood to yield good ideas)

#### Recipe #1: Start with what your team is especially good at.
- Leverage your unique expertise and insights.
- Ideas generated this way automatically have founder/market fit.
- Example: Rezi (founders had real estate/debt financing expertise).

#### Recipe #2: Start with a problem you've encountered.
- Solve your own problems.
- Ideally, focus on problems you're in an unusual position to see.
- Example: Vetcove (founders' dad was a vet, saw his annoying supply ordering process).

#### How to Use Recipes 1 & 2 Systematically (AtoB Method)
- Pick an Idea Space: Choose a fertile area where you have some expertise or connection (e.g., trucking industry for AtoB).
- Talk to Potential Users: Drive to truck stops (or wherever users are) and talk to them about their problems.
- Talk to Other Founders: Ask founders in that industry about the problems they see or face.
- Evaluate Ideas: Systematically evaluate the potential ideas generated against the 10 questions framework before picking one. (AtoB evaluated several before landing on fuel cards).

#### Recipe #3: Think of things you personally wish existed.
- The classic "scratch your own itch" method.
- Example: DoorDash (founders wanted food delivered to their dorm).
- Caution: Be mindful this can lead to "tarpit ideas" if not carefully evaluated.

#### Recipe #4: Look for things in the world that have changed recently.
- Identify new technologies, regulations, platform shifts, or societal changes.
- Ask: What new opportunities do these changes create?
- Example: COVID-19 pandemic leading to opportunities like Gather Town.

#### Recipe #5: Look for new variants of successful companies.
- Take a proven successful model (a "proxy") and apply it to:
  - A new geography (e.g., Rappi = DoorDash for LatAm).
  - A new vertical/customer segment.
- Example: Nuvocargo (Flexport for US-Mexico trade).

#### Recipe #6: Talk to people and ask what problems they have.
- Challenge: This requires skill to do well.
- Recommendation: First, pick a fertile idea space (using Question #10). Then, talk to people (potential customers and founders) within that specific space to identify worthwhile problems.

#### Recipe #7: Look for big industries that seem broken.
- Identify large, established industries with obvious inefficiencies or poor customer experiences. These are often ripe for disruption.

#### Bonus Recipe: Find a cofounder with an idea.
- Leverage platforms like YC's Cofounder Matching. Many people have ideas but need a cofounder. This can solve both problems simultaneously.

## Part 4: Counterintuitive Qualities of Good Startup Ideas

Often, ideas that seem bad possess qualities that actually make them good because they deter less savvy founders:

### Hard to Get Started
Ideas requiring difficult initial steps (like negotiating a special bank deal for Stripe) scare many people off, leaving the opportunity open.

### Boring Space
Unsexy industries (like payroll software for Gusto or veterinary supplies for Vetcove) are often overlooked by founders seeking "fun" ideas, despite having real, acute problems and large markets. The hit rate for "boring" ideas is often much higher than for "fun" ideas.

### Existing Competitors
As discussed (Question #4), the presence of competitors validates the market. If you have a genuine insight or can execute better, a crowded market can be a great place to start.

## Conclusion: Launch and Find Out

While frameworks and questions help evaluate likelihood, the only way to know for sure if a startup idea is good is to launch it and see how the market reacts. If you've gone through the evaluation and are still uncertain but leaning positive, the best advice is often to launch and find out.
